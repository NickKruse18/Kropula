Version History:
1.0.1, June 30 2023:
    Fixed some issues with NPVCSample not working.
    Fixed the uniform parameter in NPVCSample such that TRUE correctly assumes val is given quantiles.
    Updated documentation for NPVC to match its current definition.

  1.0.0, June 7 2023:
    Changed the NPVC model to allow for parametric pairwise copulae.
    Added the bivariate Gaussian copula to the possible parametric copulae in the NPVC model.
    Improved the bivariate copula estimator by reverting some changes and by relaxing some criteria.
    Changed the default bandwidth for the kernel to inversely scale with sample size.
    Updated documentation for NPVC to include the independence sensitivity.
    
  0.1.2, June 4 2023:
    Added a new function NPVCFill that can simulate missing values.
    Added a parameter to NPVC that changes the sensitivity of the independence test.
    Improved the bivariate copula estimators performance and stopped it from giving negative densities.
    Added documentation for NPVCSample and NPVCFill.
    Fixed an issue with the NPVCSample not working.
    

  0.1.1, May 20 2023:
    Added internal test for bivariate independence to improve performance.
    Changed how an NPVC model is stored to reduce memory usage and allow for more freedom in the vine specification.

  0.1.0, May 16 2023:
    Initial release.
    Added two functions to estimate (NPVC) and conditionally sample (NPVCSample) non-parametric vine copula models.
