Version:
  0.1.2:
    Added documentation for NPVCSample and NPVCFill.
    Added a new function NPVCFill that can simulate missing values.
    Added a parameter to NPVC that changes the sensitivity of the independence test.
    Improved the bivariate copula estimators performance and stopped it from giving negative densities.
    Fixed an issue with the NPVCSample not working.
    

  0.1.1:
    Added internal test for bivariate independence to improve performance.
    Changed how an NPVC model is stored to reduce memory usage and allow for more freedom in the vine specification.

  0.1.0:
    Initial release.
    Functionality to estimate and conditionally sample non-parametric vine copula models.
